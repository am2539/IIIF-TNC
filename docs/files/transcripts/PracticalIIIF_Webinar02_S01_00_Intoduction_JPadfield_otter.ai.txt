Okay, good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to webinar number two of our project practical applications of IIIF as a building block towards a national digital collection. My name is Joe Padfield, I'm the principal investigator on this project, and I work at the National Gallery. This webinar today is related to IIIF services and tools. As I said, this is webinar number two, the link to our project website is down the bottom of the slide there, where you can find all the details, including presentations and videos from the first webinar, which went really well. Our Twitter account is @practicalIIIF. I know it looks like there are four 'I's there, but the last one is actually the 'l'. And if you are wanting to Twitter today, we've got the hashtag #practicalIIIF, again, just the same as the user account, which would be great. So we can keep track of all the discussions. Now for those of you who do not know, the IIIF practical applications, the IIIF project is part of a larger collection of projects underneath the banner of Towards A National Collection. I'm not going to go into all of the details about them now. But there are a number of foundation projects each have produced interim reports. And there is a link there and all the details can then be also be found on the project website, or the towards a national collection programme website. This project is a collaboration between a number of institutions as you can see on the slide, and I'm not going to name everybody specifically as we have a lot of presentations to go through today. But these talks and all the talks and my slides will be available afterwards, we're going to record all of the presentations and make them available on the project website for later and we will let everybody know where the links are for them too. Now, the first session we're going to split today's event into two sessions. So we have a series of presentations about 10-12 minutes long, with a small amount of time for questions. After that we will have a short break, and then we'll have a discussion panellists discussion section after in session two, and which we can explore a number of questions that come out of the first talks but many have some more generic issues about people working with IIIF
